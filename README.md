## Install

/!\ [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) must be installed on your machine. /!\

At the root of this repository:

1. `cp .env.example` `.env`
2. Complete/change your `.env` file's values if necessary
3. `docker-compose up` (this might take a little while to start-up on the very first time)

You can then navigate through the UI in your browser (`http://localhost:[FRONTEND_PORT])`), or
call the back-end API (`http://localhost:[BACKEND_PORT])`)
