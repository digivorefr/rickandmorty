# Rick and Morty Vue Frontend
**Uses the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation) to display characters in a Vue frontend UI**

## 🌈✨🍰 Vanilla version 🍡🍦🍬
This is a vanilla javascript version of the [master](https://github.com/digivorefr/rickandmorty/tree/master) branch

## Installation
- clone the repo into a web server
- reach the index.html page

## Embedded Nodejs server
- The docker-compose.yml file can launch a very simple node+express server to serve the index.html page without any web server.
- **You'll need [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your system.**
- Once the repo cloned, copy the .env.example file into a new .env file
- `cd [CLONED_DIRECTORY]` then run `docker-compose up`
